# Σκοπός
(Skopos - Purpose)

**A different contract pack.**

These contracts will test your skills: the overall goal is to leave mission design (orbit choice, constellation design) to you, instead of forcing a particular solution (such as a specific orbit specified by the contract).

Gradually explore the depths of the Kerbin universe, discover radiation fields, learn how to build your first global satellite navigation system, provide satellite infra structure (TV, telecommunication, internet), do long-term observations of Kerbin and the sun.

## What it is about

Finding solutions to mission requirements that are similar to real life mission constraints. Most of the contracts require at least basic understanding of orbital dynamics and astrophysics. You will need careful planning and the ability to execute your plan without much room for error. This time, moar boosters just won't cut it.

Most contracts will be easer to finish when you launch more than the absolute minimum of satellites required. But there is a caveat: you will need equipment that is extremely expensive. The bulk of the cost of your rockets will go towards the payload, so plan wisely and be careful with the launches.

You will have to answer a set of questions: which orbit do you choose, and where? How many satellites do you need? Could you do it with one less to save a lot of money on the payload?



### Discover Radiation fields

Magnetic fields and radiation belts need to be researched before they can be seen in the tracking station. Radiation fields are discovered independently, so you might see an inner radiation belt but not know about the outer radiation belt until later - or the other way around. Some bodies have very oddly shaped fields in unexpected locations - so good luck with that!


### Terrestrial Infrastructure

Be an internet and TV service provider! You probably did geostationary orbits before, but have you ever had to make sure that the satellite will stay exactly in location? This is what TV satellites do: they need to be directly above a given location at all times, without interruption, for an extended period of time. Easy, right? But what do you do if the location is nowhere near the equator? Find a solution!


### Navigation Systems

Everybody knows GPS. But do you know its predecessor, and how it worked? Create your own networks of navigation
satellites that satisfy the unique demands of the technology they're built on!


### Observe the Earth

Build a satellite network with earth observing sensors for a wide range of applications: weather satellites, long term topology observations for agriculture, wildfire detection and tracking and many more!


### Observe the Sun

Launch new scientific missions to observe the sun. Find new orbits that allow uninterrupted solar observations for years, and for better predictions of solar activity, look at the solar surface from all directions.


## What it is not about

Easy money and free science. These are not "put a vessel this orbit and then push a button" type of contracts. You will get a set of mission parameters, finding the solution is up to you. Looking at real life missions will provide clues.
